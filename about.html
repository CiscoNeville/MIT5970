<h1> About Us </h1>

<p> Hi everyone! My name is Neville Aga. My passion is computer networking and luckily I get to do this quite a bit, as I work for Cisco Systems. Right now, I am working towards my master&#39;s degree in Management of Information Technology at the University of Oklahoma. When I am not working or going to class, I like to spend my free time with my family or creating websites. My favorite college football team is Auburn. WAR EAGLE!! </p>

<p> Hello guys! My name is Griffin Pierce. I am originally from Edmond, OK but now live in Norman, OK as I am pursuing my master&#39;s degree at the University of Oklahoma (OU) in Management of Information Technology. Before starting my master&#39;s degree, I earned a bachelors degree in Accounting from OU. During this time, I was also a member of the golf team. I currently work as a student assistant in the University of Oklahoma Athletic Department. Growing up in Oklahoma my whole life, I am naturally a huge OU football fan. BOOMER SOONER! Outside of school and work, I like playing golf and ping pong as well as going to OKC Thunder games.<br>

<h1> Why did we create saturdaycoach.com? </h1>

<p> This project came together through one of our master&#39;s level classes. Our professor asked us to create a data driven application with at least 10 web forms. Originally, we were not planning on working together, but as our teacher was going around the class talking to students about their project proposals, we figured out that we both wanted to do something with college football. For the project, Neville focused on gaining insight into 2 point conversions and when they were most successful. He also looked at what teams were most successful with two point conversions. Griffin, on the other hand, worked to present data in ways different than how it is presented on ESPN and Yahoo, which led to more valuable insights into college football. We both gained substantial knowledge about college football by creating saturdaycoach.com and we want to share it with you!  </p>
